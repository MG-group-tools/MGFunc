# MGFunc
MGFunc is an automated pipeline for annotating metagenomic gene catalogues using remote homology based functional assessment and phylogenetic analysis for function and taxonomy. It provides a workflow solution on protein level to process large metagenomics data resulting from high-throughput sequencing experiments. MGFunc offers the researchers a customizable tool to identify, cluster and analyze the protein space. The main input to the pipeline is a set of unknown protein sequences and the outcome is a list of annotated ortholog clusters and novel ortholog clusters that are presumably functional homologs.
